# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository is a comprehensive collection of code examples covering a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a valuable resource for students, educators, and software developers looking to deepen their understanding of fundamental computer science concepts. The examples included span various types of data structures and algorithms, illustrating their implementation, usage, and efficiency in solving complex problems.

## Overview

The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and exploration of different DSA topics. Each section is dedicated to a specific category of data structures or algorithms, complete with examples and explanations.

### Data Structures

Data structures are a critical part of software development, enabling the efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. This repository includes examples of:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

### Algorithms

Algorithms are the step-by-step procedures for performing tasks or calculations. This repository covers a variety of algorithmic concepts, including:

- Sorting (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
- Searching (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
